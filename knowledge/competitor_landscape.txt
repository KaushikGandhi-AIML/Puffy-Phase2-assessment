Title: Mattress Industry Creative Saturation — Patterns to Avoid

The DTC mattress category (Casper, Purple, Nectar, Saatva, etc.) is crowded with repetitive creative concepts:

Common clichés competitors use
1. Mattress unboxing
2. White bedroom aesthetic
3. Scientific diagrams
4. “Doctor recommends it”
5. “Try it for X nights”
6. People yawning
7. Couples demonstrating motion transfer
8. Mom carrying heavy mattress vs light mattress
9. Beauty rest & generic “upgrade your sleep” copy
10. “Bed in a box” demonstrations
11. Testimonials and review quotes
12. Actors waking up smiling in slow motion
13. Voiceover saying “life-changing sleep” or “sleep better every night”

These are all oversaturated and should be avoided.

Goal: Puffy should break patterns in the first 3 seconds.
Competitors rarely use: POV camera angles, sound-design-led storytelling, futuristic or sci-fi imagery, interior POV, intelligent humor, unexpected metaphors.
