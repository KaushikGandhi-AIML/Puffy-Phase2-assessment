Title: High-Performance YouTube Hooks (Luxury Market)

On YouTube, the first 2–3 seconds are critical.

Effective hooks for premium audiences:
- Pattern interrupts
- Unexpected camera POV
- Jaw-dropping visuals
- ASMR or cinematic sound moments
- Surreal / impossible imagery
- Punchy statements
- Minimalist black screens with powerful text
- Lifestyle flexing (but subtle)
- High-quality aesthetic shots

Examples:
- "This is what sleeping on a cloud actually looks like."
- A hand sinking into slow-motion hyperfoam
- POV from inside the mattress
- A floating person above the bed
- A subtle sound drop + cinematic ambiance
- A luxurious bedroom morphing into a futuristic space

Avoid:
- Long intros
- Talking heads
- "Hi, I’m here to tell you about a mattress…"
- Anything resembling a traditional TV commercial
